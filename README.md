# mojo-csv

`mojo-csv` is a lightweight library for parsing and writing CSV files that adheres closely to the Python standard library's `csv` module. It aims to provide an intuitive and familiar interface with additional features for enhanced usability.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This software is in a early stage of development, using the Mojo nightly version.

## Features

- **CSV Reading**: Supports reading from and writing to CSV files with a familiar API.
- **Custom Delimiters**: Easily specify custom delimiters, quote characters, and line terminators.
- **Data Validation**: Includes optional data validation during parsing.
- **Compatibility**: API similar to Python's `csv` module for easy transition and minimal learning curve.

## Installation

2. **Add the CSV Package** (at the top level of your project):

    ```

## Example of usage

```mojo
from csv import reader

fn main():
    with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
        csv_reader = reader(file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', doublequote=True)
        for row in csv_reader:
            print(','.join(row))
```
